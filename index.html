											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><p>NAME: Colin Madusanka Jayasekara.</p><p></p>
										
									<p>STUDENT ID: S3670061</p><p>EMAIL: S3670061@student.rmit.edu.au</p><p>DATE OF BIRTH: 21/08/1996</p><p>My name is Colin Madusanka Jayasekara but my full name is Jayasekara Mudiyanselage Colin Madusanka Jayasekara which happens to be title given by kings to those who are loyal to the throne, I was born on 21st August 1996. My Student ID is S3670061 and my email is S3670061@student.rmit.edu.au.</p><p>I am a Sri Lankan born in Colombo, Sri Lanka and I was born to a Buddhist family, hence I am classified as a Buddhist. I am a 23-year-old Male with a height of 173cm (or 5’8) and I am currently living in Melbourne, Australia attending The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) studying for my Bachelors of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering, I am due to complete my course in 2021 and I hope to be working in a aerospace company or start my own in Australia or Sri Lanka, I also speak 2 languages Sinhala and English and I am also open to learning more languages.</p><p>Hobbies:


</p><p>My favorite hobbies include Playing games, watching videos on YouTube and Daydreaming about multitudes of possibilities that might/might not occur. I also like to research random things on the internet when it comes to my mind, like how to code in Python or how to make mini Drones/Rockets or watching any other sort of documentary that I feel like intrigues or interests me.

											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li><p></p>
										
									<p>I take interest in the formation of the ‘internet’ and how it went from a luxury afforded by some to an everyday staple component of every household, Business and personal life of the current populous. I also took interest in how such a vast database exists and how it was powered in a way which allowed the entirety of the planet to be connected to the same information filled databases at the same time regardless of the time and place of viewing. I was small when I came into contact with the internet and I was very interested in games where I would spend hours playing or searching for the right kind of games which is where my interest of IT started, I also went onto realize that games and just basic information was not the only thing I could obtain and with the school curriculum aiding me in IT and my own curiosity leading me to dive more into the world of the internet, I would go on to learn the best ways as well as tips and tricks on how to best get information which are still useful methods to me personally today.</p><p>An event that sparked my further interest of the internet was my obsession with Aliens and all related Extraterrestrial events that may or may not have happened around the world, it even went to an extent where my entire family was going through the internet with to find ’definitive’ evidence of Alien life out in the universe or visits by them to our planet. Overall my experience with IT and everything related from the internet, computers to academic and workplace uses and my vested time in the world of IT has shown me the Pros and Cons of the use if IT, I know how to get information, which to use and which not to use and also where to avoid to stay out of unnecessary trouble. I have made friends who without IT and its marvel would have continued be strangers forever. I am truly grateful for all that the world of IT has allowed me to achieve until now.</p><li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li><p></p><p></p><p>.</p><p>RMIT had the degree I wanted to pursue and it also was in Australia which is a country I preferred going to compared to America due to safety and distance between the 2 countries. RMIT showed competency when it came to taking care of its students, also the facilities provided and those that were under construction showed great promise of helping me in my academic activities and hence decide that the best course of action was to take my future and have it nurtured at RMIT. I hope I get to a good position in Life and I my career with the degree I hope to obtain in 2021.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li><p>.
</p><p>I am doing BEng in Aerospace Engineering with Introduction to IT an 2nd year elective, therefore I’m hoping to get all resources and experience in my core course which is Aerospace engineering while also growing better and more competence in IT area which will allow me to hopefully stand out more from my peers due to its importance in current day and age and also with the experience and knowledge this will course provide me with which I will be able to apply in my work life and help further my career.
