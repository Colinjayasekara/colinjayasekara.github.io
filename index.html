											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li><p></p>
										
									<p>I take interest in the formation of the ‘internet’ and how it went from a luxury afforded by some to an everyday staple component of every household, Business and personal life of the current populous. I also took interest in how such a vast database exists and how it was powered in a way which allowed the entirety of the planet to be connected to the same information filled databases at the same time regardless of the time and place of viewing. I was small when I came into contact with the internet and I was very interested in games where I would spend hours playing or searching for the right kind of games which is where my interest of IT started, I also went onto realize that games and just basic information was not the only thing I could obtain and with the school curriculum aiding me in IT and my own curiosity leading me to dive more into the world of the internet, I would go on to learn the best ways as well as tips and tricks on how to best get information which are still useful methods to me personally today.</p><p>An event that sparked my further interest of the internet was my obsession with Aliens and all related Extraterrestrial events that may or may not have happened around the world, it even went to an extent where my entire family was going through the internet with to find ’definitive’ evidence of Alien life out in the universe or visits by them to our planet. Overall my experience with IT and everything related from the internet, computers to academic and workplace uses and my vested time in the world of IT has shown me the Pros and Cons of the use if IT, I know how to get information, which to use and which not to use and also where to avoid to stay out of unnecessary trouble. I have made friends who without IT and its marvel would have continued be strangers forever. I am truly grateful for all that the world of IT has allowed me to achieve until now.</p><li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li><p>.</p><p>RMIT had the degree I wanted to pursue and it also was in Australia which is a country I preferred going to compared to America due to safety and distance between the 2 countries. RMIT showed competency when it came to taking care of its students, also the facilities provided and those that were under construction showed great promise of helping me in my academic activities and hence decide that the best course of action was to take my future and have it nurtured at RMIT. I hope I get to a good position in Life and I my career with the degree I hope to obtain in 2021.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li><p>.
</p><p>I am doing BEng in Aerospace Engineering with Introduction to IT an 2nd year elective, therefore I’m hoping to get all resources and experience in my core course which is Aerospace engineering while also growing better and more competence in IT area which will allow me to hopefully stand out more from my peers due to its importance in current day and age and also with the experience and knowledge this will course provide me with which I will be able to apply in my work life and help further my career.

										<p></p>link: https://rollsroyce.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/professional/job/Indianapolis/Vice-President-of-Strategic-Capture_JR6051910?source=APPLICANT_SOURCE-3-73<p></p>
										
									<p>The position I have found is in the aerospace sector at Rolls Royce and the position is Vice President of Strategic Capture in America which essentially means is that as the VP of Strategic Capture, the individual will be required to make and find winning strategies that would win the company more deals and expansion space of the business when it comes to contracts where good relationships with the ‘right’ people that would be needed to stand out from the competition. Further responsibilities will require the individual to create, monitor and review approved Proposals each week and also being the decision maker and control point of all essential development and Pricing teams under the position of VP as well as managing internal capture projects as well as external ones in other parts of the company and country. This position appeals to me since I feel like I would be able to better balance the needs of the Engineers with the requirements of the investors which in all aerospace companies have seen a more imbalance towards the requirements of the investors without genuinely inquiring into the issues and constrains the engineers are facing.</p><p>The posting states that a Bachelor’s degree is a basic requirement with over 12 years (preferably) experience as well over 10 years’ experience with a master’s degree and a JD/PhD with over 6 years’ experience with a US Citizenship. Therefore, the applicant must have over 15 years of experience in the same field or related sector with thorough knowledge in managing teams and large scale projects that expand countrywide and also with experience in dealing with defense departments and related law enforcement authorities.</p><p>I currently have no work experience whatsoever and therefore lack any actual experience in the Aerospace sector or in any sector whatsoever, However I have experience in working in teams for university group projects and I have been a team player and have taken my respective load for each group I’m placed in and I am hoping to take charge with upcoming group projects by being the team leader. I am currently on my second semester of my 2nd year at RMIT where I’m continuing to study Aerospace engineering and hopefully by next year I would employed at a workplace in Melbourne.</p><p>I plan to obtain these required skills by completing my Bachelors and Master’s degree at RMIT while obtaining some work experience in the related field and then to go to a full time job at an aerospace company where I will work up from the entry Aerospace Engineer position while obtaining further knowledge on the subject as well as making connections with higher industry individuals and expanding my exposure as a candidate to other companies in the sector as well as the company higher-up individuals. </p><p></p></div></div>
